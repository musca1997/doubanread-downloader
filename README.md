# doubanread-downloader

## reclamation
1. it's only a demo so if you wanna download books under your account you need to add the cookie part.

and the error could occur and the process would stop, you can add a ` try... except` yourself

2. don't use it for malicious purposes. this program is only for studying.


## requirement

the python version i used to test is **python3.6.5**

pip install selenium

pip install requests (if you want to add the cookie thingy)

## usage

edit `.py` file and put the book link in it

`python downloader.py`
